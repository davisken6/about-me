  </header>

  <main>

<p> My name is Kendrah Davis. I am 26 years old and still living where I was born, NC. I am currently a food and beverage server at a local restaurant here in Greensboro. I don't have any experience in the technical field yet. I have worked as a: 
  <ul>
  <li>server,</li>
  <li>salesperson,</li>
  <li>call center agent,</li>
  and much more...
</ul> 
Once I graduated high school, I went to community college for a couple of years. I took some time off after that, then went back for another year. Since then, I have decided to persue software development with the help of Code Fellow's online coding bootcamp. I hope to find a steady job in the field that I enjoy that also makes a positive difference in the world.</p>
