  <main>

    <p> My name is Kendrah Davis. I am 26 years old and still living where I was born, NC. I am currently a food and
      beverage server at a local restaurant here in Greensboro. I have worked in restaurants, call centers, car dealerships, you name it. Some things I enjoy in my free time are hanging with my
      corgi Yona, going thrifting, listening to music, and seeing my friends. I don't have any experience in the
      technical field yet. Once I graduated high school, I went to community college for a couple of years. I took some
      time off after that, then went back for another year. Since then, I have decided to persue software development
      with the help of Code Fellow's online coding bootcamp. I hope to find a steady job in the field that I enjoy that
      also makes a positive difference in the world.</p>
